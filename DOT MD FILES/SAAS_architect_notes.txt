You are an expert SAAS architect, full-stack engineer, and educational assessment system designer.
Your task is to design and generate a fully detailed system specification for a CBT-style exam preparation platform for Nigerian WAEC and JAMB students.
All outputs must be 95% accurate, scalable, modular, and developer-ready.
 
1. System Purpose
The system is a subscription-based online CBT practice platform for WAEC and JAMB.
It must support:
•	Continuous question uploads
•	Topic-based organization
•	Random test generation
•	Student analysis
•	Tutor-controlled topic tests
•	Monetization via three subscription tiers
•	PDF & DOCX question ingestion with optional AI topic tagging
 
2. Question Bank Requirements
2.1 Continuous Expansion
Admins must be able to upload new questions at any time.
2.2 Metadata Tags for Each Question
Each question must include:
•	Exam type → WAEC or JAMB
•	Subject
•	Topic
•	Sub-topic (optional)
•	Difficulty (easy/medium/hard)
•	Year (optional)
•	Question type: Objective (A–D), Theory, Passage-based
•	Correct answer
•	Explanation (optional)
2.3 Upload Formats
Admin should be able to upload questions via:
•	PDF
•	DOCX
•	CSV
•	JSON
The system must provide:
🤖 2.4 Automatic Extraction & Topic Classification (AI-enabled)
•	Extract text and images from PDF/DOCX
•	Auto-split into question + answer choices
•	Auto-detect subject
•	AI recommends topics using NLP
•	Admin can edit topic suggestions before saving
•	Bulk upload supported
2.5 Manual Mode
Admin may also manually enter questions through a form.
 
3. Exam/Test Generation (Student Mode)
3.1 Student Flow
Student logs in → chooses WAEC or JAMB → chooses subjects → chooses number of questions → test begins.
3.2 Supported Subject Lists
System must maintain separate, complete subject lists for:
WAEC Subjects (full list required)
(Mathematics, English Language, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Commerce, Government, Literature, CRS/IRS, Geography, Accounting, Data Processing, Agric Science, Further Mathematics, Marketing, Civic Education, etc.)
JAMB Subjects (full list required)
(Use of English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Government, Economics, Literature, CRS/IRS, Commerce, Accounting, Geography, Agriculture, etc.)
3.3 Question Count Options
•	Full WAEC Standard
•	Full JAMB Standard (40 per subject, 60 for English)
•	Custom → 20 / 30 / 50 / 100 / user-selected
3.4 Randomization Logic
When a student starts a test:
•	Randomly select questions across topics
•	Ensure topic balance where possible
•	Mix difficulty levels
•	Avoid repeating questions used earlier (if possible)
•	Shuffle answer options A–D
•	Shuffle question order
•	Allow fresh random set for every new attempt
3.5 Test-Taking Interface
•	Timer (optional or exam-standard)
•	Navigation panel
•	Submit button
•	Auto-marking
•	Result summary
 
4. Tutor / Teacher Mode
Tutors can:
•	Choose exam → subject → topic
•	Enter number of questions
•	Generate topic-specific tests for students
•	Assign test links
•	View student performance per topic
This supports classroom teaching & revision.
 
5. Student Analytics Dashboard
System must generate:
•	Score per subject
•	Score per topic
•	Weak-topic detection
•	Study recommendations
•	Historical performance chart
•	Accuracy rate per attempt
•	Strength heatmaps
 
6. Subscription System (SAAS Model)
Three Monthly Tiers in Nigerian Naira
⭐ Tier 1 – Basic (₦1,500/month)
•	WAEC or JAMB (choose one)
•	1 full CBT per day
•	No tutor mode
⭐ Tier 2 – Standard (₦2,500/month)
•	Access to both WAEC & JAMB
•	Unlimited CBT practice
•	Analytics dashboard
•	Topic-based practice
⭐ Tier 3 – Premium (₦4,000/month)
•	Everything in Standard
•	Tutor mode
•	Advanced analytics
•	Priority support
•	Optional offline mode (if mobile app supports caching)
System must support:
•	Auto-renewal
•	One-time purchase
•	Expiration reminders
 
7. Admin Dashboard Requirements
Admins must be able to:
•	Upload/edit/delete questions
•	Approve AI-classified topics
•	View user growth analytics
•	Manage tutors & students
•	See revenue and subscription data
•	Export system logs
•	Manage subject & topic lists
 
8. Technical Requirements
8.1 Architecture
•	Backend: Node.js / Python (Django/FastAPI) / Go
•	Frontend: React / Next.js / Vue
•	Database: PostgreSQL (recommended)
•	Caching: Redis
•	Storage: AWS S3 or Cloudinary
•	PDF/DOCX parsing: Tesseract OCR + NLP pipeline
•	AI topic classification using embeddings (OpenAI, local LLM, or custom model)
8.2 Security
•	JWT authentication
•	Secure question endpoints
•	Anti-scraping protection
•	Encrypted subscriptions
•	Rate limiting
 
9. Exam Simulation Mode
Provide a mode that replicates the official WAEC or JAMB UI, including:
•	Color scheme
•	Timers
•	Navigation
•	Question layout
 
10. Database Schema Requirements
AI should generate:
•	Full relational database schema
•	Tables for users, subscriptions, payments, questions, subjects, topics, attempts, results, analytics, tutor groups
 
11. Output Requirements for AI
When using this prompt, the AI must output:
•	System architecture
•	Database schema
•	Data models
•	API endpoints
•	User flows (diagrams if possible)
•	Randomization algorithm
•	OCR + Topic-Classification pipeline
•	Subscription workflow
•	Full admin panel functions
•	Deployment plan
•	Scaling recommendations
•	Security considerations
